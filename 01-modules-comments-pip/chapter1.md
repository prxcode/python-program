Absolutely! Below is a more complete, **short and clear** `notes.md` version for Chapter 1. It includes brief explanations and examples for better understanding, and it's formatted for Markdown as you'd include in your project.

# Chapter 1: Modules, Comments & pip

---

## 1. Writing the First Python Program

Python programs are written in `.py` files. The simplest program is one that prints a message:

```python
print("Hello, World!")
````

This line tells Python to display the text. To run the file, use a terminal:

```bash
python hello.py
```

## 2. Understanding Modules

A **module** is a file containing Python code — functions, variables, or classes — that can be reused.

* Built-in modules: Already available in Python (e.g., `math`, `random`)
* Custom modules: Files you create with Python code

Usage:

```python
import math
print(math.pi)
```

Modules help keep code organized and reusable.

## 3. Using pip for Package Management

`pip` is the package installer for Python. It lets you install and manage external libraries.

* To install a package:

```bash
pip install package_name
```

* To uninstall:

```bash
pip uninstall package_name
```

* To list installed packages:

```bash
pip list
```

Use `pip` to extend Python’s functionality by using community-built libraries.

## 4. Using Python as a Calculator

Python can evaluate arithmetic expressions directly:

* `+` (addition)
* `-` (subtraction)
* `*` (multiplication)
* `/` (division)
* `**` (exponentiation)
* `//` (floor division)
* `%` (modulus)

Example:

```python
result = (3 + 2) * 4
print(result)  # Output: 20
```

Useful for quick calculations or embedded math in code.

## 5. Comments in Python

**Comments** are lines in code ignored during execution. They are used to explain and document the code.

* Single-line comment:

```python
# This is a comment
```

* Multi-line comment (using triple quotes):

```python
"""
This is a
multi-line comment
"""
```

Good commenting makes code easier to read and maintain.
