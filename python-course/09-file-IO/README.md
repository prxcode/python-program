# Chapter 9: File I/O Operations in Python

This demonstrates how to work with files in Python using various File I/O operations across **text**, **CSV**, and **binary** files.

It includes examples of reading, writing, appending, seeking, truncating, and more using built-in Python functions and modules.

## File Types Covered

1. **Text Files (`.txt`)**
2. **CSV Files (`.csv`)**
3. **Binary Files (`.bin`)**

## Operations Demonstrated

| Function          | Description                                                      |
|------------------|------------------------------------------------------------------|
| `open()`         | Open a file in a specific mode (read, write, binary, etc.)       |
| `read()`         | Read the entire content or a number of bytes                     |
| `readline()`     | Read one line at a time                                          |
| `readlines()`    | Read all lines as a list                                         |
| `write()`        | Write a string to the file                                       |
| `writelines()`   | Write a list of strings to the file                              |
| `append()`       | Add content at the end of a file                                 |
| `seek()`         | Move the file pointer to a specific byte                         |
| `tell()`         | Get the current file pointer location                            |
| `flush()`        | Force write buffered content to disk                             |
| `truncate()`     | Resize the file to a specified length                            |
| `close()`        | Close the file                                                   |
| `isatty()`       | Check if the file is connected to a terminal                     |
| `fileno()`       | Get the file descriptor                                          |
